# Diabetes Detection Prediction

## Dataset Description

This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The study and analysis of this data hold paramount importance, given the rising prevalence of diabetes as one of the most common chronic diseases globally. Early diagnosis of diabetes can lead to more effective treatments and better outcomes for patients.

The purpose of this dataset is to provide a means to predictively diagnose diabetes in patients based on specific diagnostic measurements. A unique aspect of this dataset is its focus on female patients over the age of 21 with Pima Indian heritage.

Contained within are:

A detailed dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle, with specific diagnostic measurements that serve as potential predictors for diabetes.
Notebooks that encompass data exploration, visualization, and modeling, guiding users through the entire data science pipeline.
Multiple machine learning models, ranging from decision trees to logistic regression, each offering unique insights and predictions on the data.
This repository not only serves as a platform for predictive modeling but also underscores the importance of early diabetes detection and the value of data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

## Report on Diabetes Diagnostic Models

Aiming to enhance the predictability of diabetes diagnosis, we conducted an in-depth analysis using various models on a dataset sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The results obtained offer valuable insights into the efficacy and applicability of each model:

- **Random Forest:** The Random Forest approach, which integrates multiple decision trees to achieve more generalized results, yielded an ROC score of 0.92. This metric, combined with an accuracy of 0.85, indicates the model's high capability in differentiating between positive and negative cases of diabetes.

- **Logistic Regression:** This model, utilizing a logistic function to model the probability of a particular outcome, achieved an ROC score of 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.82. These values underscore its efficiency in classifying the data, albeit slightly inferior to Random Forest.

- **KNN:** The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm relies on the proximity of data points to make predictions. For this dataset, KNN produced an ROC score of 0.86 and an accuracy of 0.79, suggesting a moderate classification capability compared to the preceding models.

- **Decision Tree:** The decision tree, segmenting the feature space into regions, generated an ROC score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 0.71. These numbers indicate that, for this specific dataset, the decision tree might have limitations in its predictive capability.

In conclusion, the Random Forest model stands out as the most suitable for this particular dataset, considering the evaluated metrics. However, it's crucial to account for practical applicability, ease of interpretation, and the model's adaptability when considering its implementation in real-world scenarios.
